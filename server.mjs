 * the guard and was served off disk by the static mount, with no cookie at all. Measured on a
 * two-shop install, anonymously:
 *
 *   /uploads/F              404   ← the guard doing its job

 * deleting a proof stopped revoking the art), and express.static answers `Cache-Control: public`
 * where the guard deliberately answers `private`, so a shared proxy caches one shop's artwork for
 * the next caller. It also covers `//api/...`, which had been missing both the auth gate's API
 * branch and the JSON 404 and answering 200 + the whole SPA shell to an anonymous caller.
 *
 * REFUSED, not rewritten. Rewriting means decoding first, and `/api/contacts/%2e%2e/admin` decoded
 * and re-normalised is `/api/admin` — that hands the caller a DIFFERENT route than the one they
 * asked for, which is a worse bug than the one being closed. A 404 grants nothing.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow so it cannot break a legitimate URL: only an empty segment, a `.`/`..`
 * segment, or an encoded slash/dot/backslash. `%20` and every other ordinary escape pass

/**
 * Gzip every text response worth gzipping.
 *
 * Nothing this app has ever served has been compressed — not by the app, and not by the shipped
 * deploy/nginx.conf either, which has no gzip block at all. So every shop pays full uncompressed
 * bytes for everything. Measured on this tree: **866 KB of JS/CSS/HTML on a cold load, which
 * gzips to 250 KB**; css/app.css alone is 121,235 → 25,164; and a board fetch that measured
 * 3.66 MB on a three-year shop against 267 KB compressed. On the counter tablet over the shop's
 * phone hotspot that is the difference between a screen that paints and one that does not.
 *
 * node:zlib is built in, so this costs no dependency.
 *
 * **It only ever touches a response whose length is already known.** That is the whole safety
 * argument, and it is not a shortcut — it is the rule that keeps this from undoing a fix that is
 * already in the gate. `GET /api/export/*.csv` deliberately streams: it sets no Content-Length,
 * answers chunked, and gets its first byte out in milliseconds on a file that runs to 8 MB and
 * up. A compressor that buffered it would rebuild exactly the whole-file-in-memory behaviour that
 * export was rewritten to remove, and it would do it silently, because the gate case that proves
 * the streaming sends no Accept-Encoding while every real browser does. So: Content-Length
 * present and under MAX_BYTES, or we do not touch the response at all. Everything worth
 * compressing sets one — res.send/res.json set it for every string and Buffer body, and
 * express.static sets it before it pipes.
 *
 * Also left alone: anything already encoded; any 204/304 or partial (Content-Range) response;
 * HEAD, whose Content-Length must keep describing the identity representation; every media type
 * outside COMPRESSIBLE, because PDFs, PNGs and the JPEGs of customer art are compressed already
 * and gzip only spends CPU to add bytes; and anything under MIN_BYTES, where the gzip header
 * costs more than the saving (`/api/jobs` on an empty shop is 93 bytes raw and 100 gzipped).
 *
 * BREACH: the session cookie is SameSite=Lax, so a cross-site request carries no session and an
 * attacker has no compressed authenticated response to measure. Same reasoning the CSRF note
 * further down gives, and it is why turning compression on here is not the trade it would be on
 * a cookie-anywhere app.

 * four releases later. A warning nobody acts on is not a fix; it is a fix that lives in someone
 * else's todo list.
 *
 * So the app learns the answer rather than asking for it. A signed-in OWNER loading the app is
 * proof of a host the shop genuinely uses. That host is remembered on the control database and
 * used for links built off unauthenticated requests from then on.
 *
 * PER SHOP, and this is the whole of it. The first version of this kept ONE platform-wide value,
 * written by whichever owner happened to make the last GET — and on an open-signup install
 * anybody is an owner five seconds after they arrive. One free trial and one GET with a chosen
 * Host header repointed the reset link for EVERY shop on the box, which is the exact takeover the
 * learned origin was added to prevent, one signup further away: the next owner anywhere on the
 * install to forget their password handed a live token to a stranger. It was persisted, so it
 * survived restarts, and nothing in the product could show or clear it. A shop may only ever
 * teach us its OWN address, and ann@alpha's reset link is built from what ALPHA's owners have
 * actually signed in on.
 *
 * It is deliberately NOT used for the rest of them. Every other link is generated behind auth,
 * where Host is whatever the shop's own staff are looking at, and overriding it there would send a
 * share link to the wrong address for anyone whose office URL and public URL differ. And on a
 * brand-new install where nobody has signed in yet this falls straight through to today's
 * behaviour, because refusing to send a new shop its welcome email is the worse failure.

 * sending reputation." The conversation reply routes are the same capability one door over, and

 * but POST /api/contacts is ungated too, so the recipient is still the sender's choice, the

 * alignment. Measured off the wire: one `staff` account sent "Your invoice is overdue — pay here"
 * to an arbitrary external address from the shop's real relay.
 *
 * Keyed per MEMBER, not per IP: the point is to bound what one signed-in account can send.
 *

 * is a mail cannon at any address on earth from a STAFF account, From: the shop, with the shop's

 * PLATFORM's account, so it is the platform's reputation being spent. Same for /invoices/:id/send,
 * /art/:id/send, /mockups/:id/send, /reorders/:id/nudge, /invoices/:id/request-payment and
 * /outbox/:id/send.
 *
 * ONE bucket for the lot (`bucket: 'outbound'`). The per-route default would have handed the same
 * member twelve independent allowances, which is not a cap, it is a speed bump.

 * before it sends, so the message is sitting in Outbox waiting to be re-sent. `PSC_OUTBOUND_MAX`
 * moves it for an install that really does mail at volume.
 *

 * floor. It used to get those six numbers by fetching /api/settings + /api/dashboard + /api/art +
 * /api/followups + /api/automations + /api/conversations and throwing away the rest: 48.12 MB and
 * 1,632 ms of blocked event loop per sidebar click, measured on a shop with 40k proofs; four floor
 * tablets reacting to one board move blocked the whole box — every other tenant included — for 6.7
 * seconds, and took RSS from 155 MB to 486 MB on a 512 MB machine.
 *
 * As six COUNT(*)s the same numbers cost 36 ms and about a hundred bytes. Each count below is
 * deliberately written to be the exact population the old client-side derivation produced, joins
 * included, so the badge does not change meaning: art_versions INNER JOINs jobs (an estimate-only
 * mockup has no job and was never counted), and unread only counts messages whose contact still
 * exists (the Inbox list is built FROM contacts).
 *
 * `open_invoices` is the one number that gets MORE correct: it came from /api/dashboard's
 * `outstanding_invoices`, which carries LIMIT 8. The sidebar only renders a dot, so nothing visible
 * changes — but the value is now the truth rather than a page size.

 * Take a proof back off a job — including the link the customer was already emailed.
 *
 * DELETE /api/mockups/:id is gated on `a.estimate_id`, and job art is written with job_id set and
 * estimate_id NULL, so it could never match: the one art-delete route in the product structurally
 * excluded the majority of art rows. Nothing else deleted an art_version except the cascade inside
 * DELETE /api/jobs/:id, so the only way to un-send the wrong customer's artwork was to delete the
 * whole job. Meanwhile /p/art/:id kept rendering it and /uploads/<file> kept serving it.
 *
 * Deleting the row is what revokes the link — /p/art/:id 404s once the row is gone — and the local
 * file goes with it, so neither the proof page nor the raw upload survives. Art already pushed to
 * the shop's own Google Drive stays in their Drive; that is their storage, and the response says so
 * rather than pretending we cleaned it up.
 *
 * An APPROVED version is the record of what the customer signed off, so it is not something to
 * click past by accident — but refusing it outright would leave the real emergency (someone else's
 * artwork, approved, on the wrong job) with no way out at all, which is the failure this route
 * exists to prevent. So it deletes, and the approval survives where an audit trail belongs: in the
 * activity log, which names the version, who approved it and when.

 * Send — or re-send — one message from the Outbox. The missing half of it.

 * Two ordinary states put a row here that nothing in the product could ever move on:
 *
 *   'draft'  Settings → Automation Modes → Follow-ups set to Manual. The card promises the system
 *            "drafts and waits for a person" and queueEmail's own comment says the message will
 *            "land in the outbox as drafts for a person to send". The person had no button, on any
 *            screen, so every drafted nudge sat there forever and Manual mode sent nothing, ever.
 *            The Outbox even rendered it as "logged" — the label for "no email is connected" —
 *            so a shop in Manual mode was told nothing was expected of them.
 *
 *   'error'  the send was attempted and the mail server refused it: wrong password, expired API
 *            token, greylisted. The estimate says "sent", the customer never got it, and the only
 *            way to try again was to re-send the estimate itself, which re-stamps sent_at and
 *            re-fires every estimate.sent automation behind it.
 *

 *
 * Three things go wrong in that one response, not one: the tenant check never runs; the header
 * block loses `Cache-Control: private` for `public, max-age=86400`, so a shared proxy caches one
 * shop's art and hands it to the next caller; and the sandbox CSP below is matched on a
 * case-sensitive path regex too, so the response inherits the app's own
 * `script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'` — an uploaded SVG (an allowed ART_MIME) then executes as
 * script on the app's own origin.
 *
 * `/Index.html` and `/Auth.html` are the same bug with a licence attached: they answer off disk
 * with the literal `__SOURCE_LINK__` still in the body, so an anonymous caller gets a fully
 * working copy of the app with no offer of the Corresponding Source. AGPL §13 is not optional and
