 *                work ticket and capacity claim, and nothing on the board says they are the same job
 *   New Customer two customer records with one name, splitting that customer's job history,
 *                lifetime value and A/R balance across two rows, with no merge anywhere
 *   Send         a live customer gets the quote, or the invoice, twice
 *
 * The button is re-enabled in a `finally`, so a refused save is still editable and the label the
 * shop was reading comes back. On the success paths the node has usually been detached by a close
 * or a repaint, and touching a detached node is harmless.

/* ---------- keyboard parity for the rows and cards a view makes clickable ----------
 *
 * Twenty-four places in public/js/views render a row or a card whose only affordance is a mouse
 * click — `<tr class="click" data-id>`, `.jcard`, `.convo-item`, `.autorow`, the setup chips.
 * The handler is delegated through on()/onOnce(), so the markup carries no button, no href, no
 * tabindex and no role: with a keyboard alone you cannot open an estimate, an invoice, a job, a
 * customer, a conversation or an automation. That is not a rough edge, it is the product behind
 * a mouse.
 *
 * Fixing twenty-four call sites would leave the twenty-fifth broken, so it is fixed once, here,
 * as a property of the app. Nothing about the mouse path changes and no view changes.
 *
 * Three things this has to get right:
 *  - A <tr> or <td> keeps its table semantics. role="button" on a row tells a screen reader it is
 *    no longer a row, which costs more than it buys, so table elements get tabindex only.
 *  - It must not hijack a control INSIDE the row. automations.js:62 puts a checkbox inside the
 *    clickable row and followups.js puts a Nudge button in the last cell — Space and Enter there
 *    belong to the checkbox and the button, not to the row around them.
 *  - Rows arrive after this file runs; every render is an innerHTML. So it watches for them.
 *
 * The `typeof window` guard is load-bearing, not decoration: bin/gate.mjs imports this module
 * under plain Node, where window and document do not exist, and an unguarded reference here
 * throws ReferenceError at import time and takes twelve unrelated assertions down with it.

 * .drop and .csv-drop are on the same list for the same reason. Every file the app accepts —
 * artwork onto a job (board.js:350), the Autopilot logo, both CSV importers, the DTF trimmer,
 * the gang-sheet builder — arrives through a <div> or a <label> with an onclick and a
 * `hidden` file input behind it. A hidden input is not focusable and a div is not either, so
 * attaching art to a job had NO keyboard path at all: not Tab, not Enter, not Space. Enter on
 * the zone now clicks it, which is exactly what the mouse does, and the native picker opens.

 * already has. A label that WRAPS its control is left alone: that is already a valid association.
